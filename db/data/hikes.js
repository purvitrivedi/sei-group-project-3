The distance of the Laugavegur is 54 kilometres, which can be covered in four days. Many also choose to trek onwards to Fimmvörðuháls to Skogar, meaning another one to two days of hiking. However, this section of the hike especially requires good weather. Highlights of the Laugavegur are the coloured mountains in Landmannalaugar, the glaciers you will see around you and the green valleys around Þórsmörk, where you’ll end the walk. Note that you cannot buy food along the way, and that you need to carry everything yourself. There are various river crossings, sometimes hip deep, and therefore bringing wading shoes is recommended. Although the altitude is not incredibly high, you are still in alpine environment. Generally the trail is open from end of June until the end of August and despite the fact you’re in Iceland in summer, you need to carry four-season gear without a doubt.',

Authorities strictly regulate access – you can walk freely to 400m, but you\'ll need a guide (such as the knowledgeable guides at Magmatrek) to continue any higher. It\'s also worth remembering this is an active volcano – with a major eruption as recently as July 2019 – meaning this climb, though beautiful, comes with a level of additional risk.',

An easy loop walk begins in the tiny village of Gavarnie, past the Hôtel du Cirque and horse stables, and then follows the stream up to the head of the valley. With almost no incline, this trail lends itself to more of a stroll than a hike. In the distance, glacier-formed limestone rock walls soar 1,700 meters and enclose the small valley, creating the impression of a cathedral in nature.Adding to the theatrical splendor are numerous rushing waterfalls that tumble from the snow-dusted summits (over 3,000 meters in altitude). The most impressive is the Grande Cascade, which drops for over 400 meters, making it the tallest waterfall in Europe. The park has no modern developments, only small rustic chalets, pastures of grazing goats, and little footbridges that cross the gurgling mountain stream. Chirping birds complete the tranquil, meditative experience. The gentle, circular walk takes about one hour from start to finish.  For a more challenging hike in the Pyrenees National Park, advanced hikers should take the trail up to the Brèche de Roland mountain pass (at 2,807 meters). The route begins at the Col de Tentes and leads to the French-Spanish border. The hike takes about four hours and involves a steep ascent, as well as clambering over some rocks, but magnificent views make the effort worthwhile.',

You’ll find all kinds of rock formations with white, red and orange colours – it’s simply stunning! The hiking trail is circular and you can find different kinds of spaces, such as the Sahara, the Chimney of the Fairies or the White Desert. All these spaces will amaze you, especially if you love taking pictures of natural themes. The trail is open during the whole year, except for January. Make sure you take good hiking shoes, since the rocks can be slippery, especially after rain. Paid parking outside the park near Rustrel, 10 km from the lovely village of Roussillon',

    description: 'If you tried counting the waterfalls on a map of the village Sixt-Fer-à-Cheval and you might get lost before even starting your hike! The gorgeous cliffs of the horseshoe-shaped (fer à cheval) valley shimmer with thundering waterfalls. The valley itself hosts numerous sheep and hikers from early May until early November but hiking outside of this time isn’t advised due to extreme avalanche danger. An easier 60-minute hike tours visitors around the horseshoe, but if you are interested in a little more adventure try hiking the trail to the End of the World (le Bout du Monde), a 4-hour, well-marked hike to the far end of the valley. You don’t need to be an alpinist to conquer this hike, but do wear hiking boots! The trail starts out as a large path through the trees, but once you leave the trees behind, the trail becomes narrow and the cliffs are steep. The hike starts at the left side of the valley. Leaving the fields of ponies behind, you enter the national nature reserve of Sixt-Passy. Snow-capped mountains and impressive peaks like the Corne du Chamois (2560 m) and the Mont Ruan (3040 m) rise high above you and, if the physical effort doesn’t do it, the views will take your breath away. Before starting the more challenging part of the hike, rest your feet in one of the comfortable chairs of the Chalet du Boret, before walking on to the End of the World. The reward for climbing the 270 meters to the end of the valley are some of the most spectacular views of the French Alps you can find from a day hike. The way back to the parking lot covers the right side of the valley where, once again, you will be surprised by magnificent waterfalls, remnants of avalanches, alpine meadows, and adorable mountain sheep.',

The way the “Sea of Ice” has been reducing over the last few decades is worrisome, but still is a spectacular sight. There’s a very scenic train from Chamonix that takes you to the glacier, but if you’re in the area during summer, it’s much more fulfilling to hike there. You’ll face an altitude gain of about 900  meters in a 14 km loop circuit that will take you 4-5 hours to complete. You also have the option of taking the train up and hiking down. This is a summer hike that can be done from June to August. If you want to try in autumn or spring, most likely you’ll need crampons since still there will be big patches of snow. And, as the hike is steep, it can be dangerous if you’re not experienced in this kind of terrain. The path goes inside a beautiful forest, where it’s not uncommon to run into deer. At the end you’ll be rewarded with France’s largest glacier, stunning views of the Grandes Jorasses massif in the background and Les Drus on the side. And, after descending 500 steps from Montenvers, you’ll be able to get inside the glacier at grotte de glace, the ‘ice cave’! *Tip* It’s recommended to take your own snacks and water to avoid the crowds and the steep prices!',

    description: 'France is an incredible country for hiking! Regardless of the region, there’s a bipedal adventure to be had in its great and diverse outdoors. Of all the places that I was lucky enough to explore, Domancy, in the Haute-Savoie, was undoubtedly one of my favourites. It offers some of the most spectacular hiking I ever found in the country. It’s just down the road from the popular ski resort of Chamonix, though they’re worlds apart in terms of size, glitz and glamour. Domancy is far smaller and quieter, but shares all of the same beauty of the area around Mont Blanc. Much to my frustration, I can’t remember the exact details of the hikes I did there in terms of names and precise starting points! However, that shouldn’t matter too much. In the months outside winter, hikes litter this landscape wherever you go. One that stands out in my mind was near the stunning emerald waters of Lac Vert. This little lake is set high up on the opposite side of the valley from Domancy. Cross over from the town, and venture (by car) up the long and winding road up to the side of the mountain, headed towards Praz Coutant. It was in this particular area that I can highly recommend you go for a hike! Expect the hiking to be fairly strenuous here, with some reasonable uphill stretches that’ll get the legs pumping. Likewise, be prepared for snow outside of summer. The winter season will make this off-limits to ordinary hikers (get your ski boots on instead), and the snows can even persist into spring time too. We had to turn back due to a snow block on the path. Otherwise, the paths are well maintained and take you through some of the most glorious scenery in Europe. Enjoy!',

    description: 'At 900km long and with 50km of climbing, the Pyrenean Way is not going to be to everyone’s taste but for shear variety, this well-marked path takes the biscuit. It meanders through the bucolic Basque country with its half-timbered farmhouses and then climbs up to St-Jean-Pied-de-Port where it crosses the Way of St James. Continuing ever higher through Iraty, one of the biggest beech forests in Europe, it comes out into the open, a mere scratch on the rocky flanks of the peaks. Here it reaches its highest point at 2734m above sea level. For those who like a little challenge, the summit of Petit Vignemale is a mere hour away. Continuing eastwards, forest reappears in Ariège, though the path is often above the treeline, affording trekkers silver-lined vistas of the cloud-sea, washing from side to side in the valleys below. Finally, the path tumbles between cork oaks and cacti back to sea-level and dives towards the Mediterranean. But it isn’t just about the views. There are bears and wolves here, though walkers are unlikely to see any. There is a slightly better chance of meeting an ibex. And the certainty of deer, marmots and Pyrenean chamois. Just as interesting are the encounters with the locals always willing to explain how traditional farming works. And one of the great things about walking the Pyrenean Way is the camaraderie engendered by the shared challenge of walking across a continent. If you do want to go hiking in France but feel that walking for two months would be too big a bite to chew, there are several access points and many walkers plan to complete the route over four summers.',

    name: 'Camino Francés, Stage 1',
    description: 'The Camino de Santiago is a medieval pilgrimage trail that leads to Santiago de Compostela in the northwest corner of Spain, where the remains of St. James are kept inside the Cathedral. In medieval times, pilgrims began their journey simply by walking out their front door, so there are many different versions of the Camino de Santiago that start from different points all over Europe. However, the most famous route, and the one that most people are referring to when they talk about walking the Camino, is the Camino Francés, or the French Way. While there are many possible starting points in France, the most popular is St. Jean Pied de Port, a picturesque village in the Pyrenees. From here, pilgrims cross the Pyrenees mountains, arriving at the monastery of Roncesvalles at the end of a long but spectacular hike. For those walking all the way to Santiago, this is just the first day of an 800-kilometer journey that will take more than a month to complete. But of course, you are welcome to do only the first stage and end your hike in Roncesvalles. Just beware that the Camino has a way of enchanting people, so you may very well find yourself returning one day to complete it!  Along the way, there is a small hotel called the Auberge Orisson that offers meals, but you should still bring plenty of water and snacks. Vegetarians and especially vegans on the Camino de Santiago should be prepared to self-cater. While there is an albergue de peregrinos (pilgrims’ hostel) at the monastery in Roncesvalles, you will only be allowed to stay here if you have a credencial, or a “pilgrim’s passport” as it’s often called in English. A couple of hotels and posadas nearby offer private rooms. Otherwise, check bus schedules carefully to make sure you will be able to catch the last bus back to St. Jean.',

What better way to revive weary feet than a dip in the Med? Landscapes vary considerably as the lush forests and mountain meadows of the first half of the walk give way to more arid and rocky terrain, and finally to the briny breezy plains of the littoral. It is a route steeped in both history and legend. The Cathars were brutally persecuted for their beliefs in Medieval times and fled to hilltop castles. Of these, three stand out: Montsegur, Peyrepetuse and Queribus, impossibly perched on dizzying precipices, and commanding stunning views over the local area and towards the high tops of the Pyrenees. As if that’s not enough, there are also rumours that the Holy Grail may have ended up in this part of the world, and anyone who has read the Da Vinci Code will spot some familiar places en route. More recently in 2012, the prominent and spectacular Pic de Bugarach became central to an ‘end of the world’ event as thousands of people headed for the mountains’ slopes believing that an alien spaceship was going to save them! Make sure to check out some of the local markets along the way too. Esperaza on a Sunday morning in particular is a special experience, full of life, music and characters. It is also full of vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free delights to feed a hungry hiker. And of course, as you approach the Mediterranean you enter the Corbieres, famous for its rich, herb scented wines. Overall the walk is of moderate difficulty and is suitable for all times of year, though bear in mind that it can get very hot in summer, and also surprisingly cold in the winter (especially at night).
